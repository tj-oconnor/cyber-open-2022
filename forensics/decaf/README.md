## Description

Well that's embarrassing. I tried to sniff some wireless traffic over at a coffee shop, but for some reason I can't find anything useful in it... I thought public Wi-Fi was supposed to be insecure?

Can you help me decrypt this traffic? I don't know the password, but I've heard that they switch up the last few digits of it daily.
