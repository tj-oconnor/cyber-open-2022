# major malfunction

## Description

Our team noticed that some adversaries have been trading music recommendations once a week at the exact same time for the last several months. While the recommendations do sound like music, one of our guys thought something seemed off about all of them and it was worth further investigation. Attached is a .mid version of the song, where another one of our analysts have removed anything that could be ruled out as not being part of a message. Can you figure out what the secret message is?
