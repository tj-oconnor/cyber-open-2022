# 16-bit

## Description

During the ICC competition we where given a shellcoding challenge to make a base64 encoded shellcode, ie the shellcode could only consist of the characters "a-zA-Z0-9+/=", during an 8 hour ctf we completed it in about 1.5 hours. How long will it take you to create base16 shellcode?
